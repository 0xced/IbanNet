# IbanNet example web app

This example web app uses .NET Core 3.1 to host:

- RazorPages
- MVC controller
- API controller

There are two Debug-configurations:

- Debug DataAnnotations
- Debug FluentValidation

Some conditional logic is added to allow switching between DataAnnotations and FluentValidation, allowing us to test both validation frameworks with IbanNet integration.

Select the Debug-configuration and then run/debug the web application.
